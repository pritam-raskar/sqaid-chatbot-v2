## Failed Test Details

### Test #20: Analyze Risk Factors for Alert AML_20241120225734_LAY456789

#### Test Information
- **Question:** "Analyze the risk factors and scenarios for alert AML_20241120225734_LAY456789"
- **Category:** alert_details
- **Complexity:** high
- **Expected Behavior:** Should query alert and analyze risk/scenarios
- **Expected Tool:** query_postgresql_cm_alerts
- **Expected Filter:** `alert_id = 'AML_20241120225734_LAY456789'`

#### Failure Details
- **Status:** Failed (incomplete_response)
- **Response Time:** 71.24s (slowest query in entire test suite)
- **Session ID:** d0068271-b157-4436-a5ab-13345d35e74b

#### Error Message
```
I apologize, but I cannot analyze a specific alert without more context or
details about the alert AML_20241120225734_LAY456789. To properly assess
risk factors and scenarios, I would need additional information such as:

1. The specific financial institution or context
2. The type of transaction or activity triggering the alert
3. Customer details
4. Transaction characteristics
5. Specific red flags or unusual patterns

If you can provide more context about this particular AML (Anti-Money
Laundering) alert, I'd be happy to help you analyze its potential risk
factors and scenarios.
```

#### What Went Wrong

**‚ùå NO DATABASE QUERY WAS EXECUTED**

The system's Execution Planner/Supervisor:
1. Received the user query
2. Did NOT route to any database tool
3. Directly generated a response saying "cannot analyze without context"
4. Never attempted to retrieve the alert from the database

**Workflow Analysis:**
- Only node executed: `supervisor`
- Tool executions: **0** (should have been 1: query_postgresql_cm_alerts)
- Message flow: supervisor ‚Üí direct response (no tool routing)

#### Root Cause Analysis

**The phrase "Analyze the risk factors and scenarios" confused the Execution Planner.**

**Comparison with Successful Test:**
- ‚úÖ **Test #14:** "**Summarize** alert AML_20241120225734_LAY456789 for me" - **SUCCESS** (19.93s)
- ‚ùå **Test #20:** "**Analyze the risk factors and scenarios for** alert AML_20241120225734_LAY456789" - **FAILED** (71.24s)

**SAME ALERT ID, DIFFERENT RESULTS!**

The key difference:
- "Summarize" ‚Üí System correctly queries database first, then summarizes
- "Analyze the risk factors and scenarios" ‚Üí System thinks it needs external context, skips database entirely

#### Where It Failed

**Component:** Execution Planner / Supervisor (LangGraph)
**File:** `app/intelligence/orchestration/execution_planner.py` or LangGraph supervisor node
**Issue:** Query routing logic fails to recognize that "analyze" queries about specific alert IDs should:
1. First retrieve the alert from database
2. Then perform analysis on the retrieved data

Instead, it treats "analyze risk factors" as requiring external domain knowledge.

---

## Error Classification

- **Error Type:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing Context/Data (system-generated, not actual missing data)
- **Validation Status:** incomplete
- **Technical Issue:** Tool routing failure in LangGraph orchestrator
- **Impact:** High-complexity "analyze" queries may fail despite having valid IDs

---

## Recommendations

### üî¥ CRITICAL FIX

**Update Execution Planner Prompt:**

Add explicit instruction in the Execution Planner system prompt:

```python
"""
IMPORTANT: When a user asks to "analyze", "evaluate", or "assess" a specific
alert by ID, you MUST FIRST query the database to retrieve the alert details,
THEN perform the requested analysis on the retrieved data.

Examples:
- "Analyze alert ABC123" ‚Üí First: query_postgresql_cm_alerts(alert_id='ABC123')
                           Then: Analyze the results
- "Evaluate risk for alert XYZ789" ‚Üí First: query database, Then: evaluate
- "Assess scenario for alert DEF456" ‚Üí First: query database, Then: assess

DO NOT respond with "I cannot analyze without context" if an alert ID is provided.
Always attempt to retrieve data first.
"""
```

**File to Modify:**
- `app/intelligence/orchestration/execution_planner.py` (line ~50-80, system prompt)
- OR LangGraph supervisor node configuration

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY

**Add Test Cases for "Analyze" Queries:**

Create additional test questions to validate the fix:
1. "Analyze alert STID1025_ACC102445"
2. "Evaluate the risk for alert AccRev_20241120195723_1000000000"
3. "Assess the scenarios in alert STID1021_TRD1020"
4. "Review the risk factors for alert AML_20241120225734_LAY456789"

### üü¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Add Fallback Logic:**

If Execution Planner fails to route to tools for an ID-based query, add a fallback:
```python
if alert_id_detected and no_tools_selected:
    logger.warning(f"Alert ID {alert_id} detected but no tools selected. Forcing database query.")
    force_tool_execution("query_postgresql_cm_alerts", {"alert_id": alert_id})
```

## Expected Outcome After Fix

With the recommended prompt update:

**Before Fix:**
- Test #20: ‚ùå FAILED - "cannot analyze without context" (71.24s, 0 tools used)

**After Fix:**
- Test #20: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - Queries database, retrieves alert, performs analysis (~15-20s, 1 tool used)

**Impact:**
- Success rate for alert_details: 90% ‚Üí **100%** ‚úÖ
- Success rate for "analyze" queries: Will improve across all categories

## Comparison: Failed vs Successful Tests

### ‚úÖ Successful Tests (9/10)

All these queries correctly triggered database retrieval:

1. **Test #11:** "Show details for alert STID1025_ACC102445" - 10.40s ‚úÖ
2. **Test #12:** "Get information about alert AccRev_20241120195723_1000000000" - 15.03s ‚úÖ
3. **Test #13:** "Display alert STID1021_TRD1020" - 14.64s ‚úÖ
4. **Test #14:** "**Summarize** alert AML_20241120225734_LAY456789 for me" - 19.93s ‚úÖ
5. **Test #15:** "Give me a comprehensive analysis of alert STID1025_ACC102445" - 11.45s ‚úÖ
6. **Test #16:** "What are the key details of alert with id AccRev_20241120195" - 16.80s ‚úÖ
7. **Test #17:** "Explain the alert STID1021_TRD1020 including all scenarios" - 11.61s ‚úÖ
8. **Test #18:** "Compare alerts STID1025_ACC102445 and AML_20241120225734_LAY456789" - 9.73s ‚úÖ
9. **Test #19:** "Show me the full history and details of alert STID1025_ACC10" - 10.49s ‚úÖ

### ‚ùå Failed Test (1/10)

**Test #20:** "**Analyze the risk factors and scenarios for** alert AML_20241120225734_LAY456789" - 71.24s ‚ùå

## Key Insights

### Why This Category Performs Well

1. **Clear Intent:** Questions explicitly mention alert IDs, making routing straightforward
2. **Simple Routing:** Most queries use verbs like "show", "get", "display", "summarize" which clearly indicate data retrieval
3. **No Complex Filters:** Direct ID lookup is simpler than complex WHERE clauses
4. **No Schema Dependencies:** Querying by `alert_id` doesn't require knowledge of other column names

### The One Edge Case

The only failure is a **semantic understanding issue**, not a technical database/schema problem:
- "Analyze risk factors" sounds more like a conceptual analysis question
- System interprets it as requiring domain expertise, not database data
- Simple prompt engineering fix can resolve this

---

## Conclusion

**Alert Details category is in excellent shape (90% success).**

The single failure is a **high-priority but easily fixable** issue:
- Not a database problem ‚úÖ
- Not a schema problem ‚úÖ
- Not an API problem ‚úÖ
- **It's a prompt engineering issue** with the Execution Planner

**Estimated Fix Time:** 30 minutes (update prompt + test)
**Expected Improvement:** 90% ‚Üí 100% success rate
